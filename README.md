# Task-Management-System
This is a Kanban board inspired by platforms like Trello for task management. The application should seamlessly allow users to manage tasks among different stages of completion.
1. Home: It displays all tasks, segregated by their status groups: To Do, Doing, Done.
2. Task Card: It showcases the task title and description.
3. Add Task: I have integrated a form to create a new task, prompting users for the title and
description of the task.
4. Edit Task: I have provided an option to edit an existing taskâ€™s title and description.
5. Delete Task: I have implement a feature to remove a task permanently.
6. Task Status: I have empower users to effortlessly drag and drop tasks between the To Do,
Doing, and Done categories.
7. Responsive Design: I have ensured the application is fully functional and visually coherent on
mobile devices.
