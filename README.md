# Task-Management-System
This is a Kanban board inspired by platforms like Trello for task management. The application should seamlessly allow users to manage tasks among different stages of completion.

2. Task Card: Showcase the task title and description.
3. Add Task: Integrate a form to create a new task, prompting users for the title and
description of the task.
4. Edit Task: Provide an option to edit an existing taskâ€™s title and description.
5. Delete Task: Implement a feature to remove a task permanently.
6. Task Status: Empower users to effortlessly drag and drop tasks between the To Do,
Doing, and Done categories.
7. Responsive Design: Ensure the application is fully functional and visually coherent on
mobile devices.
